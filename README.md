# E-commerce Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is a Python and SQL-based analysis of e-commerce data, designed to extract meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) from a MySQL database. By integrating SQL queries with data visualization tools, the project aims to provide a detailed understanding of customer behavior, order trends, and other critical business metrics.

## Key Features
- **Database Connection**: Seamless integration with a MySQL database for querying e-commerce data.
- **Data Exploration**: Insights into customer locations, order trends, and other essential metrics.
- **Visualization**: Use of `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visual representation of data.
